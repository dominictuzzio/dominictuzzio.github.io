    <h3> Greek Mythology</h3>
    <p> 
        Greek mythology is a rich and complex body of stories originally told by the ancient Greeks to explain 
        the origins of the world, natural phenomena, and the lives of gods, heroes, and creatures. 
        Central to these tales is the Pantheon of Olympian Gods, led by Zeus, who reside on Mount Olympus and rule over different aspects of life, 
        such as the sea (Poseidon), wisdom (Athena), and love (Aphrodite). 
        These gods were often portrayed as immortal but highly flawed, exhibiting human-like emotions like jealousy, anger, and love. 
        The mythology also features legendary heroes such as Heracles and Odysseus, who undertook epic quests and faced monstrous challenges like the Minotaur and Medusa. 
        Passed down through oral tradition and immortalized in classic works like Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. 
        These myths have profoundly influenced Western art, literature, and culture for millennia.

    <h3>Important Greek Figures</h3>
    <p>
        Ancient Greek history is defined by towering figures who laid the groundwork for Western civilization in philosophy, politics, and science. 
        The "Big Three" of Athenian philosophy—Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle—developed systematic methods for inquiry, logic, and ethics that are still taught today. 
        In politics, figures like Pericles championed Athenian democracy during its Golden Age, funding great architectural works like the Parthenon, 
        while lawgivers like Solon created the economic and legal reforms that paved the way for it. 
        Meanwhile, on the military and geopolitical stage, Alexander the Great, King of Macedon and a student of Aristotle, 
        created one of the largest empires in the ancient world, stretching to India and initiating the Hellenistic Age, which spread Greek culture across the Near East. 
        Other key figures include Homer, who composed the Iliad and Odyssey, and Herodotus, the so-called "Father of History."

    <h3>The Accomplishment of Democracy</h3>
    <p>
        The most enduring accomplishment of Ancient Greece, specifically the city-state of Athens, was the invention of democracy (demokratia), meaning "rule by the people." 
        This revolutionary system, developed through the reforms of figures like Solon and Cleisthenes, established a model of direct democracy , 
        where all eligible male citizens could directly participate in the Assembly (Ekklesia) to debate and vote on laws, military policy, and important civic issues. 
        Other critical innovations included the Council of 500 (Boule), a body of randomly selected citizens who prepared the Assembly's agenda, and the use of large citizen juries in the courts. 
        Despite its limitations (excluding women, slaves, and foreigners), Athenian democracy laid the foundational principles for modern political thought, 
        establishing the concepts of civic engagement, political equality (isonomia), freedom of speech, and the rule of law—principles that continue to shape government and society globally.

    <h3>Ancient Greece</h3>
    <p>
        The civilization of Ancient Greece flourished for over a thousand years, beginning after the Mycenaean collapse (c. 1200 BCE) and lasting until the Roman conquest. 
        It was characterized by a loose collection of independent city-states (poleis), like Athens and Sparta, which shared a common language, religion (the Olympian gods), and culture. 
        The Greeks made unparalleled contributions that form the foundation of Western civilization, including the development of democracy in Athens, 
        the systematic philosophical inquiries of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and foundational advances in science, mathematics (like Pythagoras's theorem), and dramatic theatre (tragedy and comedy).

    <br>This era also produced epic literature, such as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and highly influential art and architecture, exemplified by the Parthenon. 
        The Classical Age eventually gave way to the Hellenistic Age after the conquests of Alexander the Great, which spread Greek culture across the Near East and beyond.
