<h2>My Extra Ciriculums </h2>
<h3>My Sports</h3>
<p> In kindergarden, I started learning the basics of baseball and soccer.
    I started playing bsaseketball seriously in thrid grade. 
    My focus is baseball and soccer which I have greatly imporved in. 
    Even though I have improved, I can still greatly improve in these sports 
    and my fous is to increase my skills in these areas. </p>
<h3>My Favorite Video Games</h3>
<p> One of my hobbies outsie of sports is playing video games. 
    I like to play fast paced games like COD and GTA5. 
    This is because there can be adreniline 
    not only in the action moments but also in the slow end game moments</p>
<h2>My Traditions</h2>
<h3>Greek Traditions</h3>
<p> My family is greek and we love to elebrate it. 
    One way we do this is go to the annual greek festival. 
    It is usually in the east bay near a huge beautiful church. 
    We also make traditional greek foods and desserts to celebrate. 
    One of my favorite things that we make is baklava. 
    This is a dessert with layers of baked philo dough with <strong><em>sweet</em></strong> 
    honey or syrup and nuts (usually pistachio and/or hazenuts)

<p> One of many traditions that my family practices is making Italian food. 
    We mainly make homeade pastas and pizzas. 
    My favorite is the pizza because it is so <em>fresh</em>.</p>
