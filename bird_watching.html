    <p>
    Me and my friend Finn love bird watching together. 
    The website below shows the phtotos we have taken of these exotic animals.
    This job requires special expertise and equipment. 
    We use Swarovski Binoculars to easily spot and track the birds. We have travled to the carribean just to spot the wild flying fish. 
    We also traveled deep into Venice to capture the most magnificent bird, the pigeon. Our picture of Josh Norman or Larry, my Osrtich, 
    is special because the picture is taken after he escaped from me while I was trying to ride him. He just kept running until we cornered him and tamed him again.
