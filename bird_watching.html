    <h1>Bird Watching</h1>
    <a href="index.html"> <h2>Home Page</h2></a>
    <p>
    Me and my friend Finn love bird watching together. 
    The website below shows the phtotos we have taken of these exotic animals.
    This job requires special expertise and equipment. 
    We use Swarovski Binoculars to easily spot and track the birds. We have travled to the carribean just to spot the wild flying fish. 
    We also traveled deep into Venice to capture the most magnificent bird, the pigeon. Our picture of Josh Norman or Larry, my Osrtich, 
    is special because the picture is taken after he escaped from me while I was trying to ride him. He just kept running until we cornered him and tamed him again.
    Luke Mueller is the one and only flying chicken. This bird was lurking in the amazon while listening to his wired headphones. I distracted him and
    he didn't hear Finn behind him because of his headphones and backwards hat. Next, is the flying squirrel named Justin Son. 
    This bird was found when she was sleeping under the mythical tree from down under. 
    Before taming her she spotted us and took flight. This led to the image on Finn's page. 
    We evetnually captured and tamed her where she now lives in our backyard.
    The flying racoon, also known as Gease the Great and he is found with Mueller. 
    There's a one in eight billion chance of this bird being born. 
    Another interesting bird is our flying dolphin. He is a one of one and goes by Fitz Nawiztski.
    He lives in our inflatable pool along with Luke Mueller and the flying fish. 
    Finally, the flying clam who was found mid flight in Nebraska. 
    I named him Sally the Third after finding him with a seagul. Nebraskas wide ocean is where he is found.
     His flying capability is beyond our other birds. His flying skills are immaculate and mythical.
     <h2>The Swarovski Binoculars</h2>
    These binoculars took accesisve exploration. These were buried in a treasure chest in a cave.
     Finn and I were looking for the flying fish when we found a map in a bottle.
     This led us the the cave guarded by five ancient Mongolian warriors. 
     There was no stopping them so we pursued them with three flying fish in return for the chest. 
     This is where we found the secret forbidden weapon created thousands of centuries ago. 
     I present to you, the Swarovski Binoculars with live tracking and endless pictures. 
     It can detect animals heart beats from  miles away. This is what led us to find most of our birds.
