    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
    <h3>My Family</h3>
    <p> 
        My family plays a big role in my identity. 
        Specifically, I have one sibling, my younger sister. 
        She's important to me becuase she inspires me to be better as a person, a rolemodel, 
        and as a student. She inspires me because she is always bright and open minded
        depsite the challenges she faces. A rolemodel and hero for me is my dad. 
        This is because he looks on the bright side of things and is very intellegent. 
        Whenever I face a coflict or obstacle, I can always depend on him to help me through it. 
        He's my idol becuase I aim to be as kind as him and learn his problem solving skills/mindset.
    </p>
    <h3>My Extra Curriculums</h3>
    <p> The sports I play are baseball,basketball, and soccer. 
        I mainly focus on soccer and baseball.
        I enjoy the fast pace and competetve nature of soccer. 
        This is because it relates to my personality and identity.
        Baseball is special to me because my dad and my dad's father 
        played at baseball a young age. The game of baseball is not only fun to me but I also 
        inheit it through my family. It is apart of not only my life but my family's 
        life and history. In my spare time, I enjoy riding my bike and going out with my friends. 
        I also enjoy paintng absract art. When painting, I take inspiration from my aunt's art pieces because 
        I like her painting style and color schemes.
